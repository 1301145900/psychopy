!!Version numbers
In general, when a new feature is added the first or the second number is incremented (e.g. 1.00.05 -> 1.01.00). Those releases might break previous code you've written because new features often need slight changes to other things. 
Changes to the final digit (1.00.05 -> 1.00.06) implies a bug-fixing release or very minor new features that shouldn't require code changes form the user.
