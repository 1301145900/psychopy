  * Upstream bugfix release for 1.61 series + 2 additional commits

      that don't exist

psychopy (1.61.02.dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian packaging:
    - Moving under NeuroDebian Team umbrella
    - Boosting policy to 3.9.0 -- no changes seems to be due
    - Adding both python-pyglet and python-pygames to Recommends (they are
      also present in Depends but with the choice of one over the other).
      That should make default installations more coherent and less
      troublesome
  * Absorbed some upstream commits from svn/trunk:
    - lib: fixed bug in filters.makeGrating where gratType='sqr'
    - lib: fixed bug in new color spaces for non-shader code
    - BF: making RaingScale an explicit old-style class
      (otherwise import fails on Python 2.4)
    - removing testmovie.mpg (unknown license), using new and shiny
      testMovie.mp4
