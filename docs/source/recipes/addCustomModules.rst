Add additional python modules
================================

If you want to add some Python module/package to the Standalone PsychoPy installation you can do that, as of version 1.70.00 using the PsychoPy preferences/general. There you will find preference for `paths` which can be set to a list of strings e.g. `['/Users/jwp/code', '~/code/thirdParty']

These only get added to the Python path when you import psychopy (or one of the psychopy packages) in your script.
