Making isoluminant stimuli
=====================================

From the mailing list (see there for names, etc):

Q: How can I create colours (RGB) that are isoluminant?

A: The easiest way to create isoluminant stimuli (or control the luminance content) is to create the
stimuli in DKL space and then convert them into RGB space for presentation on the monitor.

More details on DKL space can be found here: http://www.psychopy.org/general/colours.html and conversions between DKL and RGB can be found here: http://www.psychopy.org/api/misc.html
