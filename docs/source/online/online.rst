Running and sharing studies online
=======================================

In January 2018 we began a `Wellcome Trust <http://www.wellcome.ac.uk>`_ grant to make online studies possible from PsychoPy. This is what we call PsychoPy3 - the 3rd major phase of PsychoPy's development.

The key steps to this are basically to:

- generate a JavaScript experiment ready to run online
    - either generated from PsychoPy Builder (recommended)
- upload it to Pavlovia.org to be launched
- :ref:`recruitingOnline`
