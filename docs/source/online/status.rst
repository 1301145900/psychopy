PsychoJS is modular just like PsychoPy. If something you need isn't yet available then let us know and for a small price (a few hundred pounds?) we can add it in.

Already available:

  - Logic:
    - loops (including nesting)
    - randomization
    - data outputs (csv and log files)
  - Stimuli:
    - Text
    - Image
  - Responses:
    - Keyboard
    - Mouse responses
  - Everything works on a per-frame basis (excellent timing) just as in the Python script
  - Everything has the same parameters as before (rotate your text, change color on every frame, etc)
  - Pushing data automatically to `Open Science Framework <http://osf.io>`_ projects

To be added (see http://discourse.psychopy.org/c/online for updates/discussion):

  - Inputs:
    - microphone
    - webcam
    - multi-touch responses
  - Stimuli:
    - movies
    - sound
    - rating scales
    - gratings and dots
    - apertures
  - Code components
  - Support for recruitment tools like `Mechanical Turk <https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome>`_ or `Prolific <https://www.prolific.ac/>`_
