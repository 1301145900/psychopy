.. _addToPsychoJS:

Adding features to the PsychoJS web engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PsychoJS is modular just like PsychoPy. If something you need isn't yet available then let's add it! There are these options:

  - **Contribute some cash.** Let us do it know what you need and for a small price we can add it in (typically a few hundred pounds but some components may be more than that). What? I didn't have to pay for any other part of PsychoPy - you wrote it for free - why do I have to pay for this?! The PsychoJS package was written by professional developers and they need feeding, whereas the rest of PsychoPy has been written by volunteers in their spare time. This might be a great way to spend that research slush fund, at a fraction of the cost of license fees for other packages.
  - **Get your developer to add it.** PsychoJS is open source though (see the code inside the `PsychoPy github repository <https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy>`) so you could add components yourself too if you have the JS knowledge. If you do so please contribute it back so that others can benefit.
  - **Sit and wait.** If you have no funding for your studies and no JavaScript programmer to help then you hold on. All the above will probably be done eventually but we don't know when.
