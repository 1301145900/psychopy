EPS satellite workshop,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where: `School of Psychology, University of Nottingham`_

When: 8 July 2011, 2-5pm

Cost: **Free**

As a satellite event to the EPS meeting (July 6-8th 2011) the creator of Psychopy will give a workshop, introducing the software to new users. The workshop will incorporate a brief lecture about the software. There will then be time for attendees to generate their own experiment using PsychoPy, with expert help on-hand.

The workshop is an ideal opportunity for you to find out whether PsychoPy will meet your needs for teaching and research and to get started with your own studies using this unique package. If you're interested in coming to the workshop, why not bring along stimuli from a typical study of yours and try to build it on-site in the afternoon?!

Yale, 21-23 July (inclusive)
