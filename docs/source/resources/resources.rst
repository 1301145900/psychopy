VSS 2012 Satellite Event, May 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be running a workshop for PsychoPy, as a satellite to the `Vision Sciences Society conference <http://www.visionsciences.org/index.html>`_.

    - when: Thurs 10th May, 12-5pm
    - where: Naples Grand, Banyan Room 1-2
    - cost: £75
    - target audience: novice
    - material will cover the Builder interface and simple Python coding

Email me personally (jon at peirce.org.uk) if you're interested in attending (or helping!).

There will be very limited spaces available (probably 30) in order that participants get the most out of the event. So get in touch as soon as possible.

The registration charge of £75 is to cover costs is to cover costs and, hopefully, lunch. This will be invoiced so that it can be claimed back.

The workshop will include a mixture of demonstrations and periods of users creating their own experiment in the software. Time will be spent partly on the graphical interface and partly on writing Python code. Please bring a laptop with PsychoPy installed, as well as ideas for a simple experiment to build. That will allow you to ge the most out of the session.

Lecture materials (Builder)
-------------------------------

At `School of Psychology, University of Nottingham`_, PsychoPy is now used for all first year practical class teaching. The classes that comprise that first year course are provided below. They were created partially with funding from the former `Higher Education Academy Psychology Network`_. Note that the materials here will be updated frequently as they are further developed (e.g. to update screenshots etc) so make sure you have the latest version!

        `PsychoPy_pracs_2011v2.zip (21MB) <PsychoPy_pracs_2011v2.zip>`_ (last updated: 15 Dec 2011)

If you also use PsychoPy for your lectures then please let us know so that we can link to your materials/course from here too!
