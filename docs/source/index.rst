PsychoPy is an open-source application to allow the presentation of stimuli and collection of data for a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM| . It's written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

News
====================

**Latest version**:
Version 1.50.00 released on 1 Sept 2009, including a preview of the new graphical :doc:`Builder <builder/builder>` view. With the new view you will be able to conduct experiments without writing any of your own code (although you will always be able to write the code if you prefer). As such PsychoPy2 is rather comparable to commercial packages such as e-Prime, except that it's totally free, more intuitive and can generate a much wider range of stimuli!

Documentation on this site now relates to the new version of PsychoPy. The previous website for PsychoPy version 1.xx is still available `here <psychopy1/home.php>`_
