News
====================

**PsychoPy webpage gets a facelift**: 
PsychoPy has moved from a wiki-based web site to Sphinx (for better integration with documentation)

**Latest version**:
Version 1.00.03 was released in June 2009. There is now a standalone download for Windows and OS X (containing its own python and dependencies).

ShapeStims and SimpleImageStim have been added, and many bugs fixed. See the :doc:changelog for further details.
