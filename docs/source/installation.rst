Installation
===============

Like many python modules PsychoPy is built and dependent on a number of other libraries (OpenGL, numpy...). Details on how to install those are below.

.. warning: **Python versions.** If you are downloading and installing python manually, note that you should use **Python 2.5**. PsychoPy may work with Python 2.6 will work, but it's untested. Certainly Python 3.0 will not work for now. This version is a complete rewrite of the language and will require substantial rewriting of both the PsychoPy code and the code of the dependencies.

Recommended hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bare minimum requirements for PsychoPy are a graphics card that supports OpenGL (most graphics cards do, but on windows you often need to install new drivers).

Ideally OpenGL 2.0 should be supported - certain functions run much faster with where it is available and one stimulus (e.g. ElementArrayStim) even requires it. At the time this was last updated dabs.co.uk were selling the `GeForce 9500GT <http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9500gt_us.html|nVidia>`_ for Â£45, which would be an excellent card for most experiments. 

If you're thinking of buying a laptop for running experiments, *avoid the built-in intel graphics chips (e.g. GMA 950)*. The drivers are crumby and performance is poor. Get something with nVidia or ATI chips instead.


For Windows users:
----------------------

If you're new to python then you probably want to install the standalone package. This includes a copy of python and all the dependent libraries (if you do have python already installed, that won't be touched by this installation).

Then `download`_ and install the most recent version of PsychoPy itself. Once installed, you'll now find a link to 
*PsychoPy* in >Start>Progams>PsychoPy. Click that and go to the help menu to see some demos working.

You should **make sure you have reasonably current drivers for your graphics card** (download the latest from the vendor, rather than using the pre-installed windows drivers). 

You might also want to **add C:/Python25 to your Windows path**. To do that, right-click "My Computer" and select properties. Select the "Advaced" tab and the "Environment Variables" button. Now, in the System Variables window, double-click "path" and add the text `C:/Python25/; C:/Python25/scripts;` (somewhere in the line).

For Mac OS X users:
----------------------

There are different ways to install PsychoPy on a mac that will suit different users

* Intel Mac users can simply `download`_ the standalone application bundle (the *dmg* file) and drag it to their Applications folder. The app bundle contains its own independent python and all the dependencies and will not interact with anything else on your system (except its own preferences).

* Users of `macports <http://www.macports.org/>`_ can install PsychoPy and all its dependencies simply with:
    ``sudo port install py25-psychopy``
(thanks James Kyles for that).

* For PPC macs (or for intel mac users that want their own custom python for running PsychoPy)
The easiest way to install all the dependencies is to use the `Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/epddownload.php>`_. It's free (for academic use) and the only things it misses are `avbin <http://code.google.com/p/avbin/>`_ (if you want to play movies) and `pygame <http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml>`_ (for sound reproduction). You could alternatively manually install the 'framework build' of python and download all the dependencies below.
 
If you take this last method you can update to the latest version by opening a terminal and typing:
    ``sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install-2.5 -N -Z -U psychopy``


For Linux (and other UNIX?) users:
--------------------------------------------
For (k)ubuntu users the installation is very straightforward:
    
    #. install (most of) the dependencies with::
    
        sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-matplotlib python-imaging python-setuptools
        sudo apt-get install python-opengl python-wxgtk2.8 python-pygame
        
    #. try one of the following options (the first is better for jaunty?)
        #. download the source zip file from `googlecode downloads <downloads>`_, unzip it in /tmp, enter the folder, and then::
        
            sudo easy_install -Z -U pyglet
            python setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/PsychoPyEgg
            sudo easy_install -Z /tmp/PsychoPyEgg/PsychoPy-*.egg
            
        #. simply run::
        
            sudo easy_install-2.5 --prefix /usr/local -N -Z -U pyglet psychopy

Dependencies
----------------------

If you want to install each library individually rather than use the simple distributions of packages above then you can download the following. Make sure you get the correct version for your OS and your version of Python.

* `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`_ (2.4.x or 2.5.x, NOT version 3)
* `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_
* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ (version 0.9.6 or greater)
* `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`_ (version 0.4.8 or greater)
* `pyglet <http://www.pyglet.org>`_ (version 1.1 or greater)
* `pygame <http://www.pygame.org>`_ (for playing sounds. Must be version 1.8 or greater)
* `pywin32 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_ (only needed for *Windows*)
* `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org>`_ (version 2.8 or greater)
* `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ (easier to install with setuptools/easy_install)
* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ (for plotting stuff)
* `winioport <http://www.geocities.com/dinceraydin/python/indexeng.html>`_ (to use the parallel port, win32 only)
* `ctypes <http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/>`_ (this is already included in python 2.5)
