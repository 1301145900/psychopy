Screenshots
=====================================

A few screenshots are provided here to give you a flavour, but it's easier to download the software and run the demos (from the demos menus in each view) to see the variety of stimuli that can be generated. 

The :ref:`coder` view, for those that like to program (or just use your own editor), and the :ref:`builder` view for those that don't:

PsychoPy can handle every type of stimulus you can imagine...
