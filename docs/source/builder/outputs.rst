Generating outputs (datafiles)
-------------------------------

There are 4 main forms of :ref:`output <outputs>` file from PsychoPy:
   - Excel 2007 files (.xlsx) see :ref:`Excel Data Files <excelFile>` for more details
   - text data files (.csv or .dlm) see :ref:`Delimited Text Files <textFile>` for more details
   - binary data files (.psydat) see :ref:`PsychoPy Data Files <psydatFile>` for more details
   - log files (.log) see :ref:`Log Files <logFile>` for more details


Binary data files (.psydat)
===============================

It is strongly recommended that you produce this form of file from all of your experiments even if you do not intend to use it. These files contain all the information about the experiment that was run and can be used to (re)create Excel and delimited files and even the experiment code itself.
