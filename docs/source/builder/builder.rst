Builder - generating experiments with a GUI
================================================

.. warning::

    As at version v1.50.00, the builder view is very much alpha-testing software. It is provided as a preview of what PsychoPy will be providing in the future, and so that users can provide feedback on how it can be improved.
    It should not be used for serious, especially complex, experiments for now. It is very likely that experiments created in builder v1.50.00 will not be opened in future versions of PsychoPy (although any script generated by this version will likely run in future versions).
