Emotiv Recording Component
-------------------------------

The Emotiv Recording component causes Psychopy to connect to the headset so that markers can be sent.

The Emotiv Recording component should be added before any stimuli have been presented.  We recommend that you use the Emotiv software to establish that the headset is connected before running the experiment with Psychopy.
