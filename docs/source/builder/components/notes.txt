1) When the Vector class is implemented, all stimuli with a position param will also have an "anchor" param - this is essentially "where on the stimulus is the position set from" - you can see how this will work in Textbox which already has an "anchor"
2) When the Color class is implemented, there will be a lot more colour spaces. You can see what these will be in:
    psychopy.colors.colorSpaces
3) Should we add in things like "Save onset/offset times"? They're not in the docs currently but it might be good for users to know what they are, especially now that there's a clear structure to it
