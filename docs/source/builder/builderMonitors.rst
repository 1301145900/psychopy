Monitor Center (in Builder)
---------------------------

This can be found by clicking the icon which shows two screens.

You should always enter your monitor information (viewing distance, size, screen width). If you do not enter this information and wish to use degrees as a unit of measurement the size of components will not be accurate. For more details see :ref:`monitorCenter`
