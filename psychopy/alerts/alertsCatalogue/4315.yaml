msg: Builder cannot interpret value "{param.val}" of {param.label} for {component.type} component "{component.params[name].val}" as a dollar sign has been used incorrectly.

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Invalid dollar sign syntax.

synopsis: |
  This alert is received when a dollar sign has been used incorrectly in a stimulus parameter.

details: |
  By putting a dollar sign at the beginning of a parameter value, you can indicate that the parameter should be interpreted as code rather than as a string. However, a dollar sign should not appear anywhere else in the parameter value, as this will cause errors compiling later.

solutions: |
  If the dollar sign is a part of a string, you can indicate this by putting a `\` before it to mark it as "literal". Otherwise, remove any dollar signs which are not at the very beginning of the value.
