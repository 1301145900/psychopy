synopsis: |
  This alert is received when a font has been installed to PsychoPy from Google Fonts.

details: |
  Google Fonts is a repository of thousands of free fonts, which PsychoPy is able to access on-the-fly, allowing you to use any font within the Google Fonts library (fonts.google.com) as if it were installed on your machine. We achieve this by getting the font from the respository and storing it in your user preferences folder, this alert is just to let you know that the font file has been successfully saved.
