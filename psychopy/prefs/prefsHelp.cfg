###     HELP for preferences in PsychoPy2
###    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

##      Preferences allow you to customize how PsychoPy looks and works.
##      Remember to SAVE before closing the Preferences window.

[Overview]
# You can customize things for yourself (as a 'user'), or for everyone on this 
# computer (the 'site'). Your user preferences over-ride the site preferences
# (which in turn override the default settings that come with PsychoPy2).

[Example]
# If you like small, lean icons, copy the 'largeIcons = True' line from
# the 'site' page, and paste it into your 'user' page, under the section
# named [app]. Then replace 'True' with 'False', and save your prefs. That is, 
# copy things to get the syntax right, then edit to change the value. Most 'site'
# prefs have a note of explanation on the line above them (as a commment).

# Be sure to paste it under the proper section, or else it will be ignored.

# Not all changes take effect immediately. For example, changing the icon size
# will only be noticeable when you make a new builder or coder window.

# You can change what key-presses have what effect in PsychoPy's menus. To do so:
# copy and paste "<function> = <key-code>" from the 'keys' page to your 'user' page, 
# and then change the key-code to what you want it to be. 

[How_To]
# SET a pref:  Select and copy a 'setting = value', then paste it into the right 
#     section of your 'user' page, then edit the value part. Some settings require
#     restarting PsychoPy to take effect. 
# SET a key pref:  Only a user with write-permission for the psychopy prefs 
#     files can change the 'keys' prefs (doing so for the whole site). Just edit
#     the value in the 'keys' page, following the syntax there.
# RESET your user preferences:  Just delete them from your 'user' page, and save. If
#     that is not possible, you'll need to delete your userPrefsFile using your
#     computer's operating system to do so. (The file name is shown at the bottom
#     of your 'user' prefs page.) Then restart PsychoPy.
# RESET the SITE and KEYS to defaults:  Set 'resetSitePrefs = True', and then save
#     preferences. The site prefs are restored to the defaults that come with PsychoPy,
#     but you'll need to close and then open the preferences dialog to see the changes.
#     User prefs are NOT reset by this. keys are reset.

[Glossary]
# A COMMENT is any line starting with a #, such as this one.
# SETTINGS are shown in BLACK, and are paired with a value:

setting = value

# Values canbe numbers, true / false, strings, or even lists.
# A few settings require a comma-separated LIST instead of a value. 

my_list = item1, item2

# Just a comma alone means an empty list (you still need the comma).
# If comments are shown in GREEN, you can edit the settings on that page.
# If comments are BLUE, no editing is possible (the file is read-only).
# A SECTION name is text enclosed in square brackets, like this:

[this_is_a_section_name]

# Each 'setting = value' pair belongs to a section. Here, the setting
# 'setting_52' belongs to the section 'section_5'

[section_5]
setting_52 = True
